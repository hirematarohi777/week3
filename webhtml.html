        Dr. Monica Hanna has always carved out her own path, no matter the odds. As a little girl living in Egypt, 
        she was determined to be an archaeologist and encouraged to do so
         by her motherâ€”even despite the fact that it was, and still is, a male-dominated field.Today, 
         Dr. Hanna is not just a leading archaeologist, but also a celebrated scholar, Founding Dean of the 
         Cultural Heritage and Archaeology Unit at The Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, 
         and an inspiration to women in the Arab world including her 5-year-old daughter.
